## <a id="2-2-0"></a> v2.2.0

**Release Date: August 5, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Adds PCF Healthwatch indicators for on-demand plans. Healthwatch now shows metrics from newly-deployed service instances, with alert thresholds predefined.
  For more information, see [PCF Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/index.html).

* Operators can enable TLS for On-Demand Service Instances.
  Before doing this, ensure that you have followed the steps in
  <a href="preparing-tls.html">Preparing for TLS</a> and
  <a href="installing.html#network-configuration">Network configuration</a>.<br>
  In most cases enabling TLS does not noticeably reduce performance. This depends, however, on network infrastructure, application architecture, and other such resources being in good shape.

<%= partial "../../redis/partials/redis/warning-disabling-tls" %>

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fixes:

* Updates open source Redis to v5.0.5, which includes fixes for CVEs and issues
that caused crashes in very rare cases.

[Redis 5.0 release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES).

* Updates golang to v1.12.6.
For release notes, see the [golang documentation](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.12.minor).

* Updates on-demand service broker to v0.31.1.

* Updates the cf CLI to v1.16, which resolves
[CVE-2019-3781: CF CLI does not sanitize user's password in verbose/trace/debug](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2019-3781).

### Resolved Issues
