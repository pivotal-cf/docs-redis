## <a id="2-4-5"></a> v2.4.5

**Release Date: March 2, 2022**

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

* **The Shared-VM Broker Registrar errand no longer fails with Ruby Buildpack v1.8.50:**
The errand now succeeds when pushing the test app with the Ruby Buildpack v1.8.50.
This was resolved by deleting the `.bundle` directory and the `BUNDLED_WITH` version
specification from the `Gemfile.lock` file on the test app.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issue:

* **The test app fails to start:** The timeout for smoke tests causes the test app to fail to start.

**Release Date: October 8, 2021**

### Features

New feature in this release:

- **Support for TLS v1.3:**
  For information about setting TLS versions,
  see [Upgrade Procedure](upgrade.html#procedure) in _Upgrading Redis for VMware Tanzu Application Service_
  and [Configure On-Demand Service Settings](installing.html#on-demand-config) in _Installing Redis for VMware Tanzu Application Service_.

### Known Issues

* **The Shared-VM Broker Registrar errand fails with Ruby Buildpack v1.8.50:**
The errand fails to push the test app with Ruby Buildpack v1.8.50.
This issue is caused by the `.bundle` directory and the `BUNDLED_WITH` version

## <a id="2-4-3"></a> v2.4.3

**Release Date: August 17, 2021**

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fix:

* **runc:** Updated to v1.10-rc95 to address [CVE-2021-30465](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30465).

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **A log error related to an unused component no longer appears:**<br>
This error sometimes appeared in logs as: `{"error":"Get /v2/info: unsupported protocol scheme "\""}}`.

* **Backups of shared-redis plans are working as intended:**
This issue did not affect on-demand plans. It only affected backups of shared-redis plans on newer
deployments of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.<br><br>
In the following <%= vars.product_short %> versions, backups were configured through a persistent
`statefile.json` created by the <%= vars.product_short %> tile:

    * v2.2.2
    * v2.2.1
    * v2.2.0
    * v2.1.4
    * v2.0.6

    This is not true for later <%= vars.product_short %> versions. However, backups of shared-redis
plans for these later versions still depended on the existence of that `statefile.json` file.<br>
This meant installations of <%= vars.product_short %> that had created this file, and later been upgraded, persisted the file and worked as expected. Meanwhile, newer installations of
<%= vars.product_short %> failed to backup shared-redis instances.<br><br>
This error sometimes appeared in logs as:
`{"message": "ServiceBackup.WithIdentifier.Perform backup completed with error", "error": "exit Status 3"}`

### Known Issues

This release has the following issue:

* **The test app fails to start:** The timeout for smoke tests causes the test app to fail to start.
The user receives a general error.

## <a id="2-4-2"></a> v2.4.2

**Release Date: May 10, 2021**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **Secure service bindings are configured from the UI:**
  In earlier releases, secure service bindings for Redis were always stored in CredHub if
  secure instance credentials were enabled in <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>.
  Now, <%= vars.product_short %> operators can deactivate this functionality for Redis service instances.<br>
  For information, see step 8 of [Configure On-Demand Service Settings](installing.html#on-demand-config)
  of _Installing Redis for VMware Tanzu Application Service_.

- **Redis OSS:** Updated to v5.0.10

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **The upgrade-all-service-instances errand no longer fails when TLS is enforced:**
  This issue was fixed by updating the on-demand-service-broker component to v0.41.0.

* **Healthwatch is no longer a required dependency for <%= vars.product_short %>:**
  In v2.4.1, Healthwatch was a required dependency.
  Attempting to remove Healthwatch from the foundation resulted in an error message,
  "Product Redis depends on Pivotal Healthwatch".

* **The test app fails to start:** The timeout for smoke tests causes the test app to fail to start.
The user receives a general error.

### Known Issues

There are no known issues for this release.

## <a id="2-4-1"></a> v2.4.1

**Release Date: August 20, 2020**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **Operators can specify which TLS versions to make Redis TLS connections when TLS is enabled:**
This feature allows control of the versions of TLS that Redis connections support.
VMware discourages using TLS v1.0, but it is an option for apps that only support this protocol.
For more information, see [Configure On-Demand Service Settings](./installing.html#on-demand-config).

- **Operators see an error when trying to install an incompatible Healthwatch version:**
Operators can only install Healthwatch v1.8 and later with the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
If the operator tries to install a previous Healthwatch version, the operator sees an error.

- **Operators can enable telemetry to help improve the product:**
The telemetry program enables VMware to collect data from customer installations to improve the
enterprise experience. Collecting data at scale enables VMware to identify patterns and alert you to
warning signals in your installation.
For more information, see [Pivotal Telemetry](https://tanzu.vmware.com/legal/telemetry).

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

* **Rotating the Services TLS CA certificate no longer causes app downtime:**
  In Redis for PCF v2.2 and Redis for Pivotal Platform v2.3, following the
  [Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html)
  procedure can cause downtime for apps bound to the Redis service.
  This issue does not occur in <%= vars.product_short %>.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* **Service creation can fail when using an external UAA:**
  An issue with the Redis on-demand service broker and TLS verification
  means that service creation might fail on the TLS handshake.
  This has been observed as the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand failing,
  particularly when a separate internal load balancer is present.

* **Healthwatch is a required dependency for <%= vars.product_full %>:**
  If you try to remove Healthwatch from <%= vars.ops_manager %> where <%= vars.product_full %>
  is also installed, the error message, "Product Redis depends on Pivotal Healthwatch" appears.
  For more information about this issue,
  see the [VMware Tanzu Support documentation](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Unable-to-remove-Healthwatch-from-a-foundation-due-to-Product-Redis-depends-on-Pivotal-Healthwatch?language=en_US)
  in the Knowledge Base.

* **The test app fails to start:** The timeout for smoke tests causes the test app to fail to start.
The user receives a general error.
