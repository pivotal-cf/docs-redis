## <a id="1114"></a> v1.11.4

**Release Date: July 16, 2018**

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you are upgrading from v1.11.0 or v1.11.1,
    you might need to take manual steps to avoid data loss.
    See this Knowledge Base article,
    <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000939573">Redis Tile Upgrade to v1.11.0 or v1.11.1
        May Result in Loss of Persistent Data</a>.<br><br>

    It is safe to upgrade directly from v1.10.</p>


### Features

* This release updates the packaged golang to v1.10.3.

### Fixes

* The default persistance for on-demand instances is now partial persitance
(using RDB files) this fixes the previous issue around disk usage
inflation from frequent instance restarts.

* Fixes an intermittent issue that can cause executing a restore to fail.

### Known Issues

* The redis-odb service broker listens on 12345. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html)
in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.

* The redis-odb fails if arbitrary parameters are changed in an `update-service` command.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html)
in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.

* Default persistence is set to full persistence using an AOF file. If an instance is restarted frequently (for example, for upgrades), this file can grow significantly,
leading to very large persistent disk usage. If your Redis instance has significantly larger persistent disk usage than expected,
check the size of your `appendonly.aof` file (usually at `/var/vcap/store/redis`) to verify if this is the source of the usage.
If so, you can mitigate this by running the [BGREWRITEAOF](https://redis.io/commands/bgrewriteaof) command.

* The redis-odb fails if arbitrary parameters are changed in an `update-service` command.

* Executing a restore may fail to complete and leave the CONFIG command unaliased.

## <a id="1111"></a> v1.11.1

**Release Date:  February 2, 2018**

### Bug Fixes

* This release reverts implementation of the colocated errands feature for the Redis for PCF v1.11 line,
due to incompatibility with some PCF v1.12 installations.

* For some IAASs and Multi AZ configurations, the dedicated and shared-VM broker may shift AZs when upgrading 
to v1.11.0 or v1.11.1. This can cause the broker to orphan its disk. In this case, shared-VM instances are lost and 
dedicated VMs may be overwritten. You may need to take manual steps to avoid data loss.

## <a id="1110"></a> v1.11.0

**Release Date:  January 25, 2018**

### Features

* The on-demand service is now at feature parity with the dedicated-VM service.
The dedicated-VM service will be deprecated. Please move apps to the on-demand service.

* All releases used within the tile use SHA-2 checksums.

* The tile uses [colocated errands](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/1-12/tile-errands.html)
to decrease errand runtime and VM footprint for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.0 and later.

* Users can manually and automatically back up and restore data to on-demand instances.

* For security reasons, the permissions for all Redis files for the on-demand
service have been reduced to least privileged user and lowered to minimum needed.

* Defaults for on-demand VM and disk sizes encourage correct configuration and sizing of plans.

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters,
has been disabled for security concerns.

\* As of PCF v2.0, _Elastic Runtime_ is renamed _Pivotal Application Service (PAS)_.

### Known Issues

* The errands for Redis for PCF v1.11.0 might not run successfully on some PCF v1.12 environments.
  The underlying cause is being investigated, and a v1.11.1 patch is planned.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on 12345. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html) in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.
