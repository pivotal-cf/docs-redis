## <a id="2-4-3"></a> v2.4.3

**Release Date: August 17, 2021**

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **Update bpm release to address:** "Bump runc to 1.0.0-rc95 to address
  [CVE-2021-30465](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30465)".
* **Update service-backups dependency to address log entry due to an unused component:**
  This error might present itself in logs as: `{"error":"Get /v2/info: unsupported protocol scheme "\""}}`.
* **Back-ups of shared-redis plans are working as intended:**
  This issue did *not* affect on-demand plans. It only affected backups of shared-redis plans on new deploys
  of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
  In earlier releases, backups were configured through a shared statefile.json created by the
  <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
  This dependency on the statefile.json was removed from v<INSERT_VERSION_HERE>.
  However, some codepaths within shared-redis backups still depended on the existence of the statefile.
  This meant that installations of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile that produced this file and were later
  upgraded would carry over the file.
  In most cases it would work, however, newer installations of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile would fail.
  This error might present itself in logs as:
  `{"message": "ServiceBackup.WithIdentifier.Perform backup completed with error", "error": "exit Status 3"}`

## <a id="2-4-2"></a> v2.4.2

**Release Date: May 10, 2021**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **Secure service bindings are configured from the UI:**
  In earlier releases, secure service bindings for Redis were always stored in CredHub if
  secure instance credentials were enabled in <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>.
  Now, <%= vars.product_short %> operators can disable this functionality for Redis service instances.<br>
  For information, see step 8 of [Configure On-Demand Service Settings](installing.html#on-demand-config)
  of _Installing Redis for VMware Tanzu Application Service_.

- **Redis OSS:** Updated to v5.0.10

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **The upgrade-all-service-instances errand no longer fails when TLS is enforced:**
  This issue was fixed by updating the on-demand-service-broker component to v0.41.0.

* **Healthwatch is no longer a required dependency for Redis for Tanzu Application Service:**
  In v2.4.1, Healthwatch was a required dependency.
  Attempting to remove Healthwatch from the foundation resulted in an error message,
  "Product Redis depends on Pivotal Healthwatch".

### Known Issues

## <a id="2-4-1"></a> v2.4.1

**Release Date: August 20, 2020**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **Operators can specify which TLS versions to make Redis TLS connections when TLS is enabled:**
This feature allows control of the versions of TLS that Redis connections support.
VMware does not recommend using TLS v1.0, but it is an option for apps that only support this protocol.
For more information, see [Configure On-Demand Service Settings](./installing.html#on-demand-config).

- **Operators see an error when trying to install an incompatible Healthwatch version:**
Operators can only install Healthwatch v1.8 and later with the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
If the operator tries to install a previous Healthwatch version, the operator sees an error.

- **Operators can enable telemetry to help improve the product:**
The telemetry program enables VMware to collect data from customer installations to improve the
enterprise experience. Collecting data at scale enables VMware to identify patterns and alert you to
warning signals in your installation.
For more information, see [Pivotal Telemetry](https://tanzu.vmware.com/legal/telemetry).

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

* **Rotating the Services TLS CA certificate no longer causes app downtime:**
  In Redis for PCF v2.2 and Redis for Pivotal Platform v2.3, following the
  [Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/security/pcf-infrastructure/services_tls_ca_rotate.html) procedure can cause downtime for apps bound
  to the Redis service.
  This issue does not occur in <%= vars.product_short %>.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* **Service creation can fail when using an external UAA:**
  An issue with the Redis on-demand service broker and TLS verification
  means that service creation might fail on the TLS handshake.
  This has been observed as the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand failing,
  particularly when a separate internal load balancer is present.

* **Healthwatch is a required dependency for Redis for Tanzu Application Service:**
  If you try to remove Healthwatch from Ops Manager where Redis for Tanzu Application Service
  is also installed, the error message, "Product Redis depends on Pivotal Healthwatch" appears.
  For more information about this issue,
  see [Unable to remove Healthwatch from a foundation due to "Product Redis depends on Pivotal Healthwatch" error](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Unable-to-remove-Healthwatch-from-a-foundation-due-to-Product-Redis-depends-on-Pivotal-Healthwatch?language=en_US)
