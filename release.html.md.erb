specification from the `Gemfile.lock` file on the test app.

### Known Issues

## <a id="2-3-6"></a>v2.3.6

**Release Date: August 17, 2021**

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fix:

* **runc:** Updated to v1.10-rc95 to address [CVE-2021-30465](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30465).

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **A log error related to an unused component no longer appears:**<br>
This error sometimes appeared in logs as: `{"error":"Get /v2/info: unsupported protocol scheme "\""}}`.

* **Backups of shared-redis plans are working as intended:**
This issue did not affect on-demand plans. It only affected backups of shared-redis plans on newer
deployments of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.<br><br>
In the following <%= vars.product_short %> versions, backups were configured through a persistent `statefile.json` created by the <%= vars.product_short %> tile:

    * v2.2.2
    * v2.2.1
    * v2.2.0
    * v2.1.4
    * v2.0.6

    This is not true for later <%= vars.product_short %> versions. However, backups of shared-redis
plans for these later versions still depended on the existence of that `statefile.json` file.<br>
This meant installations of <%= vars.product_short %> that had created this file, and later been upgraded, persisted the file and worked as expected. Meanwhile, newer installations of
<%= vars.product_short %> failed to backup shared-redis instances.<br><br>
This error sometimes appeared in logs as:
`{"message": "ServiceBackup.WithIdentifier.Perform backup completed with error", "error": "exit Status 3"}`

### Known Issues

This release has the following issue:

* **The test app fails to start:** The timeout for smoke tests can cause the test app to fail to start.
The user receives a general error.

## <a id="2-3-5"></a>v2.3.5

**Release Date: May 10, 2021**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **Secure service bindings are configured from the UI:**
  In earlier releases, secure service bindings for Redis were always stored in CredHub if
  secure instance credentials were enabled in <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>.
  Now, <%= vars.product_short %> operators can deactivate this functionality for Redis service instances.<br>
  For information, see step 8 of [Configure On-Demand Service Settings](installing.html#on-demand-config)
  of _Installing Redis for VMware Tanzu Application Service_.

- **Redis OSS:** Updated to v5.0.10

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

* **The upgrade-all-service-instances errand no longer fails when TLS is enforced:**
  This issue was fixed by updating the on-demand-service-broker component to v0.41.1.


### Known Issues

This release has the following issue:

* **The test app fails to start:** The timeout for smoke tests can cause the test app to fail to start.
The user receives a general error.

## <a id="2-3-4"></a>v2.3.4

**Release Date: August 31, 2020**

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

* **Rotating the Services TLS CA certificate no longer causes app downtime:**
  In Redis for PCF v2.2.11 and earlier and Redis for Pivotal Platform v2.3.3 and earlier, following the
  [Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/2.10/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-services_tls_ca_rotate.html)
  procedure can cause downtime for apps bound to the Redis service.
  This issue no longer occurs.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issue:

* **Service creation can fail when using an external UAA:**
  An issue with the Redis on-demand service broker and TLS verification
  means that service creation might fail on the TLS handshake.
  This has been observed as the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand failing,
  particularly when a separate internal load balancer is present.

* **The test app fails to start:** The timeout for smoke tests can cause the test app to fail to start.
The user receives a general error.
