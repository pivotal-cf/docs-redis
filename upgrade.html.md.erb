This topic gives you information about the upgrade paths and how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id="upgrading"></a> Compatible upgrade paths

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>

## <a id="upgrades"></a> Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/redis/warning-deactivating-tls' %>

This product enables a reliable upgrade experience between versions of the product
deployed through <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

For information about the upgrade paths for each released version, see
[Compatible upgrade paths](#upgrading).

### <a id="procedure"></a> Upgrade procedure

To upgrade to the latest version of <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Download the latest version of the product from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/p-redis).

1. Upload the new `.pivotal` file to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

1. If required, upload the stemcell associated with the update.

1. If required, update any new mandatory configuration parameters.

1. (Optional) To enable TLS:
  1.  Follow the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](./preparing-tls.html).
    <p class="note"> <span class="note__title">Note</span>
      In most cases, enabling TLS does not noticeably reduce performance. Performance impact depends on the health of resources, such as network infrastructure and application architecture.
    </p>
  1. In the Redis for Pivotal Platform tile, select **On-Demand Service Settings**.
  1. Under **Enable TLS**, select **Optional**.
  1. Click **Save**.

1. (Optional) Enable developers to upgrade service instances individually. For instructions, see
[Enable Individual Service Instance Upgrades](#individual-upgrades) below. <br>
When this is feature is not enabled, the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand runs by default
after each upgrade.
For more information, see [Upgrading all Service Instances](#all-instances).

1. Go to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. Click **Review Pending Changes** and **Apply Changes**.

### <a id="individual-upgrades"></a> Enable individual Service Instance upgrades

Until you upgrade service instances, they do not benefit from any security fixes or new features
included in the tile upgrade.
The default upgrade path automatically upgrades all on-demand service instances
when you upgrade the tile.
This operation can take a long time.

To expedite upgrades, in <%= vars.product_short %> v2.3 and later you can enable on-demand service
instances to be upgraded individually.
This allows developers to upgrade their own service instances after you have upgraded the tile.

<p class="note"><span class="note__title">Note</span>
  This feature is only available for upgrades from <%= vars.product_short %> v2.3.0 to later versions.
  You cannot upgrade individual service instances from v2.2 to v2.3.
</p>

To enable upgrading individual service instances:

1. Ensure that all service instances have been upgraded to <%= vars.product_short %> v2.3.0 or later.
If not, click **Apply changes** to run the `upgrade-all-service instances` errand.

1. In <%= vars.product_short %> tile, navigate to the **Errands** page.

1. Select **Off** for the **Upgrade All On-Demand Service Instances** errand:

    <img src="./images/upgrade-all-deactivated.png" alt="The 'Errands' pane in Ops Manager.
    The 'Upgrade All On-Demand Service Instances' section is shown, and 'Off' is selected.">

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply changes**.

After you enable individual service instance upgrades, developers can upgrade individual
service instances following the instructions in
[Upgrading an individual Redis Service Instance](./dev-upgrade.html).


## <a id="downtime"></a> Downtime during upgrades

During the upgrade each Redis instance experiences a small period of
downtime as each instance is updated with the new software components.
This downtime is because Redis instances are single VMs operating in a non-high availability (HA) setup.
To reduce downtime, you can enable the BOSH HotSwaps feature.
Compared to traditional BOSH upgrades, this feature has been shown to reduce downtime by 75%.
For instructions on how to enable this feature, see [Enable BOSH HotSwaps to Reduce Downtime](#bosh-hotswaps) below.

The length of downtime depends on whether there is a stemcell update to
replace the operating system image, or whether the Redis software is updated
on the existing VM.
Stemcell updates incur additional downtime while the IaaS creates the new VM,
whereas updates without a stemcell update are faster.

<%= vars.ops_manager %> ensures the instances are updated with the new packages and any
configuration changes are applied automatically.

Upgrading to a newer version of the product does not cause any loss of data or configuration.

###  <a id="downtime-causes"></a> Causes of downtime

A redeploy causes downtime for the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
This section clarifies what events trigger a redeploy.

#### <a id="opsman"></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> Changes

In <%= vars.ops_manager %>, any field that changes the manifest causes a redeploy of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

#### <a id="pas"></a> <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> Changes

In the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> tile, changes to any of the following properties can trigger downtime:
<ul>
  <li><code>$runtime.system\_domain</code>---Runtime System Domain</li>
  <li><code>..cf.ha\_proxy.skip\_cert\_verify.value</code>---Deactivate SSL certificate verification for this environment in PAS</li>
  <li><code>$runtime.apps\_domain</code>---Runtime Apps Domain </li>
  <li><code>..cf.nats.ips</code>---NATS Resource Config</li>
  <li><code>$self.service\_network</code>---Service Networks in <%= vars.ops_manager %></li>
</ul>

When the operator applies any of the above changes to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, downtime is triggered for:

* The Redis on-demand broker

* Shared-VM Services

#### <a id="all-instances"></a> Upgrading all Service Instances

Downtime for service instances occurs only after the operator runs the
`upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand, after all tile upgrades are completed successfully.
Any change to a field on the <%= vars.product_short %> tile causes BOSH to redeploy the
on-demand Redis broker and can cause service instance downtime when the operator runs the
`upgrade-all-service-instances` errand.

### <a id="bosh-hotswaps"></a> Enable BOSH HotSwaps to reduce downtime

Enabling BOSH HotSwaps reduces the downtime for on-demand service instances when
upgrading.
Benchmarking shows that enabling BOSH HotSwaps can reduce service instance downtime
by 75% when upgrading.
For how it works, see
<a href="https://bosh.io/docs/changing-deployment-vm-strategy/">Changing VM update strategy</a>
in the BOSH documentation.
To use this feature, all service bindings must use BOSH DNS instead of IP addresses.

To enable BOSH HotSwaps:

1. Ensure all service bindings use BOSH DNS.
To do so, tell developers to unbind, bind, and restage any apps created while
<%= vars.product_old %> v1.14 or earlier was installed.
For instructions, see the solution in [Apps fail to connect to the Service Instance](./troubleshoot-instances.html#connect-fails).
  <p class="note"><span class="note__title">Note</span>
    You must do this before enabling BOSH HotSwaps.
    Any apps with service bindings that do not use BOSH DNS fail to connect
    to the Redis service instance.</p>

1. Select the **BOSH HotSwaps** check box in the **On-Demand Service Settings** tab.

1. Click **Save** and then **Apply Changes**.


## <a id="network-upgrades"></a> Network changes after deployment

This section explains how changing the network after deploying <%= vars.product_short %>
affects instances and apps.

### <a id="network-upgrades-shared-vms"></a> Shared VMs

To change the network for shared-VM services,
click **Assign AZs and Networks** in the <%= vars.product_short %> tile configuration and use the **Network** dropdown.

You can also change the network by altering the CIDR in the BOSH Director tile.

Pivotal discourages changing the network that a pre-existing shared-VM deployment works with.

If the network is changed, app bindings for existing shared-VM instances might stop working.

### <a id="network-upgrades-on-demand"></a> On-Demand Service Instances

To change the service network for on-demand service instances,
click **Assign AZs and Networks** in the Redis tile configuration and use the **Service Network** dropdown.
The service network applies to on-demand service instances.

You can also change the service network by altering the CIDR in the BOSH Director tile.

If you change the service network, you must unbind and rebind existing apps to the on-demand Redis instance.

New on-demand service instances are placed into the new service network,
but existing on-demand service instances are not moved.
To move the data in on-demand Redis instances to a new service network, you must create a new instance, migrate the data manually, and delete the old instance.

Similarly, changing the availability zone (AZ) for an on-demand plan only applies to new on-demand instances
and does not alter existing instances.
