<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic gives you security recommendations for <%= vars.product_full %>.

To allow <%= vars.product_full %> to have network access you must create app security groups (ASGs).
For more information, see [Networks, security, and assigning AZs](./installing.html#azs).

Pivotal recommends the following best practices for security:

* Run <%= vars.product_short %> in its own network.
For more information, see [Creating networks in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/1.18/tkgi/GUID-network-profiles-opsmgr.html).

* Use <%= vars.product_short %> with the IPsec Add-on.
For information about the IPsec Add-on, see [Securing data in transit with the IPsec add-on](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Redis-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/3.3/redis-tanzu-application-service/GUID-security.html).

* Do not use a single <%= vars.product_short %> instance for multi-tenancy.
A single Redis instance of the On-Demand service should only support a single workload.

* Do not use the Shared-VM service for production use cases. It is not considered adequately secure for that purpose, even though it is designed for multi-tenancy.

* Set TLS to **Optional** and encourage app developers to make use of the TLS port.
  For more information, see [Using TLS](./appdevs.html#using-tls).
