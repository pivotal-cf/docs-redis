<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic gives you recommended use cases for <%= vars.product_full %>
and information for determining the product's fit for your enterprise's use case.

## <a id="usecases"></a> Recommended Use Cases

On-demand plans are configured by default for cache use cases but can also be used
as a datastore.

Shared-VM plans are designed for datastore use cases in testing or development environments.

<p class="note caution"><span class="note__title">Caution</span>The shared-VM service should only be used for development and testing.
   Do not use for production.</p>

Redis can be used in many different ways, including:

* Key/value store: For strings and more complex data structures including Hashes, Lists, Sets, and Sorted Sets
* Session cache: Persistence enabled preservation of state
* Full page cache: Persistence enabled preservation of state
* Database cache: Middle-tier database caching to speed up common queries
* Data ingestion: Because Redis is in memory, it can ingest data very quickly
* Message queues: List and set operations. `PUSH`, `POP`, and blocking queue commands.
* Leaderboards and counting: Increments and decrements sets and sorted sets
  using `ZRANGE`, `ZADD`, `ZREVRANGE`, `ZRANK`, `INCRBY`, and `GETSET`
* Pub/Sub: Built in publish and subscribe operations: `PUBLISH`, `SUBSCRIBE`, and `UNSUBSCRIBE`

Review the following table to determine if <%= vars.product_short %> has the features needed to support your enterprise.

<table border="1" class="table">

  <thead><tr><th colspan=2>Resilience</th><th>More information</th></tr></thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Availability</td>
    <td>All service offerings of <%= vars.product_short %> are single VMs without clustering capabilities.
        This means that planned maintenance jobs (e.g., upgrades) can result in 2â€“10 minutes of downtime,
        depending on the nature of the upgrade.
        Unplanned downtime (e.g., VM failure) also affects the Redis service.<br>
        <%= vars.product_short %> has been used successfully in enterprise-ready apps that can tolerate downtime.
        Pre-existing data is not lost during downtime with the default persistence configuration.
        Successful apps include those where the downtime is passively handled or
        where the app handles failover logic.

    Operators can configure the number of VMs and the size of those VMs.

    For the shared-VM service, the number and size of VMs are pre-provisioned by the operator.
    BOSH errands used for registration, upgrade and cleanup use short-lived VMs that cannot be configured but can be
    turned on or off.

    To prevent data loss, only scaling up is supported.
    For the shared-VM service, the operators can change the Redis instance memory limit as well as change the instance limit.

### <a id="other-notes"></a>Availability zones

On-demand <%= vars.product_short %> supports configuring multiple availability
zones (AZs) to improve resiliency.
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis service instances does not provide high availability.
This is because each individual Redis service instance is a single VM without
clustering capabilities.

The diagram below shows a Redis deployment configured with three availability zones.

![A Redis deployment across three availability zones. Availability zone one contains
the on-demand service broker, the shared service broker, shared instances, and on-demand service instances.
Availability zones two and three contain on-demand service instances.](images/availability-zones.png)

Service instance VMs are placed in availability zones as follows:

+ **For on-demand plans**: Service instances can be configured to deploy to any AZ.
  If you select multiple AZs, service instances are distributed randomly between them.
  This improves resiliency.
+ **For the shared-VM plan**: Service instances run on a single VM in the AZ in which the tile is deployed.
