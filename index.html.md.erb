##<a id="about-redis"></a> About Redis

<strong>Redis^&reg;*^</strong> is an easy-to-use, high-speed key-value store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.
It supports a range of data structures including strings, lists, hashes, sets, bitmaps, HyperLogLogs, and geospatial indexes.
It is easy to install and configure and is popular with engineers as a straightforward NoSQL datastore.
It is used for everything from a quick way to store data for development and testing through to enterprise-scale apps like Twitter.
