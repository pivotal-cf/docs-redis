title: Creating a Redis service instance with service-gateway access

You can create a <%= vars.product_full %> service instance with service-gateway access.
Service-gateway access enables a <%= vars.product_full %>  on-demand service instance to
connect to external components that are not on the same foundation as the service instance.

The following information assumes that you meet the prerequisites for using on-demand <%= vars.product_full %>.
For more information, see [Prerequisites](using.html#prereq).

If you have enabled a service-gateway plan, you can create a service instance that can connect to components outside the your foundation.
Contact your operator if you are unsure which plans are enabled for service-gateway access.
For information about the architecture and use cases, see [Service-gateway access](service-gateway-access.html).

To create a service instance that enables service-gateway access:

1. Create a service instance with the service-gateway plan by running:

   ```console
   cf create-service p.redis SERVICE-GATEWAY-PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
   ```

2. Obtain credentials by creating a service key:

   ```console
   cf create-service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME SERVICE-KEY-NAME
   ```

   The service key looks similar to the following:

   ```json
   {
     "credentials": {
       "host": "q-s0.redis-instance.mediumcandyapplered-services-subnet.service-instance-0133e917-5cbf-432d-bab3-f4db5c603539.bosh",
       "password": "apassword",
       "port": 6379,
       "service_gateway_access_port": 1100,
       "service_gateway_enabled": true,
       "tls_port": 16379,
       "tls_versions": [
         "tlsv1.2",
         "tlsv1.3"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   The `service_gateway_access_port` field informs you of the port that was reserved for the created
   service instance. You can use this port to connect to Redis from outside your foundation.

   If you deactivate and then re-activate service gateway access on a plan, you must create new
   service keys to obtain a new set of credentials for service gateway access.
