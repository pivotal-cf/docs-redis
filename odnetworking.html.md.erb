This section describes networking considerations for the Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on-demand service.

## <a id="service-network"></a>Service Network Requirement

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

<%= partial 'partials/service-networks-v3', :locals => {
  :platform_name => vars.platform_old} %>

## <a id ="on-demand"></a>Default Network and Service Network

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

<%= partial 'partials/on_demand_architecture', :locals => {
  :product_short => "Redis for PCF"} %>


## <a id="network-rules"></a>Required Networking Rules for On-Demand Services

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

<%= partial 'partials/service_networks_table', :locals => {
  :platform_name => vars.platform_old,
	:app_runtime_full => vars.app_runtime_full,

Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must ensure network
rules are set up so that connections are open as described in the table below.
